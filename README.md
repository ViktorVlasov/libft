# libft

## Description
This is the first project created as part of my studies at [School 21](https://21-school.ru/).\
In this project, my goal was to recode several functions of the C standard library, which will be used by me in subsequent projects.

I wrote my own functions for working with:

- Chars
- Strings
- Memory
- Numbers
- Related lists
- Binary trees

## Usage

* In the root directory of the repository, use `make` to build **libft.a** library
* Compile with **libft.a** (also you have to include header file **libft.h**)
* You can check list of functions in **libft.h** file.
